# Tainted Coders' Bevy Tutorial: Pong

This very, very basic Pong game has been designed and developed for the
[Bevy tutorial](https://taintedcoders.com/bevy/pong-tutorial/) by
[Nolan Tait](https://github.com/nolantait) on his website
[Tainted Coders](https://taintedcoders.com/).  Thank you very much! ❤️

This version comes from the web tutorial, not from the Git repo.
I corrected a few mistakes (that aren't in the Git version), and
divided the project into a few modules.
However, I removed the comments.  I'll put them back ASAP.
